# Spotchip

Spotchip is a grueling technical test designed to seperate the wheat from the chaff.

The starter code is outputting the first page of categoires that are being fetched from Spotify's api . Using the Spotify documentation, update the existing code to fetch the subsequent pages.

# Minimum Requirements

 - Build a paginated user interface to view the subsequent categories.
 - Update the existing code to use hooks.
 - Output the total number of pages.

##
We want to see how you would approach building this feature, get creative and feel free to rip out the existing code, it's really only there as a starting point!
