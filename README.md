# Spotchip

Spotchip is a grueling technical test designed to seperate the wheat from the chaff.

The starter code is outputting the first page of music categoires that are being fetched from Spotify's api. Using the Spotify documentation, update the existing code to fetch the subsequent pages.

## Instructions

Fork this repo.

You'll be sent a .env file that contains Spotify client keys, this will need adding to the project for the API calls to work.

## Minimum Requirements

- Build a paginated user interface to view the subsequent categories.
- Update the existing code to use hooks.
- Output the total number of pages.

##
We want to see how you would approach building this feature, get creative and feel free to rip out the existing code, it's really only there as a starting point!
